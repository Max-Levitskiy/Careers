# How do we interview?

As we build out the Fimio team, having a clear method of interviewing will be helpful to keep us moving. This methodology can change as our company does, of course, but our current process is outlined here.

Note that at Fimio, we believe in building and upholding a fair and inclusive workplace. To support this, it is important to avoice interview bias--it is unfair to the candidate and can lead to a less diverse and less effective workforce. If you have any questions on how to avoid bias while interviewing, please reach out to @seeglenn and @omoju for additinal resources and assistance. By working together to avoid interview bias, we can ensure that we are making the best hiring decisions for our team and for the success of Fimio.
