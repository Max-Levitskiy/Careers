# Data Engineer

We are a small team working on scaling human coordination. Our mission is to bring trustlessness to the application layer in Web3. We're looking for a Data Engineer that will join us as we architect and design the core system from the ground up.  

We are ambitious. We believe our technology will fundamentally change Web3. And we have the technical and research chops to back it up. Our Founder and CEO, Omoju Miller, was the Technical Advisor to the CEO at GitHub and has a world class understanding of technical online communities. 

As a Data Engineer, you will be a key part of our success and we will have a great time building the reputation mechanism that will unleash the true power of human coordination technology at a planetary scale.

This is a full-time role based out of Oakland/San Francisco. You will only be asked to come to the office when the CEO is in (typically be 2-3 days per week). 

## You will: 
- Design, build, and maintain infrastructure and data pipelines capable of ingesting large amounts of data from layer one blockchains
- Write clear, concise, tutorial type developer documentation


## You may be a fit if you have: 
- Passion for and extremely bullish on Web3
- Willingness to grow into building, operating, and maintaining resilient, and scalable distributed systems
- Experience working with systems like Presto, Airflow, and Spark
- 3+ years of experience writing code in Python, JavaScript, Go or Rust
- Experience with data on EVM-compatible blockchains is a plus but not required
- On-chain resume like a degenscore or active governance participation is a plus but not required
- Have strong written communication skills


Nothing in life is perfect, including this job description. It is not expected that any single candidate would have expertise across all the areas (in fact, one of our team members never even worked on blockchains before joining us!). You may be an excellent fit even if you donâ€™t meet all these requirements. 

We welcome all qualified persons to apply regardless of race, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status. Compensation will be competitive and commensurate with experience.
